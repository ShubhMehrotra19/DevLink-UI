# DevLink

At DevLink, we prioritize cultivating a culture that encourages responsibility and consistency in developers' social media presence. We recognize the importance of showcasing one's learning journey on platforms like GitHub, which provide essential tools for thriving in the tech industry, such as understanding CI/CD pipelines and Git commands.

## Our Vision

Our vision is to create an interactive platform on GitHub that fosters user interaction and facilitates connections among developers, particularly students from VIT Bhopal and across India.

## The Culture We Foster

Successful products often sell not just a solution but also a culture. Our aim is to instill a culture where developers not only exchange contact information but also share their "DevCards" when they meet. DevCards serve as digital business cards, enabling developers to connect globally and introduce themselves based on their qualifications and experiences.

## Our Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

DevLink's USP lies in its ability to foster a unique culture while utilizing GitHub to create an interactive student networking platform. DevCards enable developers to connect with peers globally, promoting the use of GitHub and encouraging effective networking. Unlike Linktree, a competitor that offers similar features, DevLink distinguishes itself by providing profile availability on the homepage and filtering profiles based on used languages.

## Key Features

- DevCards: Digital business cards that showcase developers' qualifications and experiences.
- Profile Availability: Profiles are readily available on the homepage for easy access.
- Language-Based Filtering: Profiles can be filtered based on the programming languages used by developers.
